### Why I made this application?
Honestly, my goal was to take a look at [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and learn it. So I built this open-source and non-profit project. Any PR is welcome and if you found a bug, i will be so glad if you report it in [issues](https://github.com/auto-wallpaper/auto-wallpaper/issues).

### DISCLAIMER
This project is purely for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial gain. It will remain open-source indefinitely.

This application utilizes automated interactions with other web services:
- [leonardo.io](https://leonardo.io/) for image generation 
- [temp-mail.io](https://temp-mail.io/) for temp emails
- [iloveimg.com](https://www.iloveimg.com/upscale-image) for image upscaling

We respect the terms of service of these platforms and will readily remove any automation upon request from their owners.
